# Challenge 1

In this first season, we must complete the fist 5 lessons in SQLBOLT: https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction .
These are the indtructions: We will be using a database with data about some of Pixar's classic movies for most of our exercises. As we progress in this lessons new tables and data will be upload in each lesson.


The instructions for each season are presented down below:



## Lesson 1:

In this first exercise will only involve the Movies table, and the default query below currently shows all the properties of each movie. To continue onto the next lesson, alter the query to find the exact information we need for each task.


+ Find the title of each film
+ Find the director of each film
+ Find the title and director of each film
+ Find the title and year of each film
+ Find all the information about each film



## Lesson 2:  Queries with constraints


Using the right constraints, find the information we need from the Movies table for each task below.


+ Find the movie with a row id of 6 ✓
+ Find the movies released in the years between 2000 and 2010 ✓
+ Find the movies not released in the years between 2000 and 2010 ✓
+ Find the first 5 Pixar movies and their release year ✓

## Lesson 3: Queries with constraints PT2

Here's the definition of a query with a WHERE clause again, go ahead and try and write some queries with the operators above to limit the results to the information we need in the tasks below.


+ Find all the Toy Story movies
+ Find all the movies directed by John Lasseter
+ Find all the movies (and director) not directed by John Lasseter
+ Find all the WALL-* movies

## SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results 

There are a few concepts in this lesson, but all are pretty straight-forward to apply. To spice things up, we've gone and scrambled the Movies table for you in the exercise to better mimic what kind of data you might see in real life. Try and use the necessary keywords and clauses introduced above in your queries.


+ List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates
+ List the last four Pixar movies released (ordered from most recent to least)
+ List the first five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically
+ List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically

## SQL Review: Simple SELECT Queries 

In the exercise below, you will be working with a different table. This table instead contains information about a few of the most populous cities of North America[1] including their population and geo-spatial location in the world. 


+ List all the Canadian cities and their populations
+ Order all the cities in the United States by their latitude from north to south
+ List all the cities west of Chicago, ordered from west to east
+ List the two largest cities in Mexico (by population)
+ List the third and fourth largest cities (by population) in the United States and their population
