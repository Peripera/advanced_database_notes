# Session – 2026-02-17

## Topics covered
- Queries with constraints
- What is table
- JOINS (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN)

## What I understood
- A table is a data structure, that containts a primary key and can reference a foreign key. 
- INNER JOIN is data that is in both tables.
- LEFT Join just data that is present en left table.
- full join fuse all the data for both tables that matches a given condition.
- CROSS JOIN is expected to be use to have all the combination possible with both tables.


## What is still confusing

- SELF JOIN I dont undestand its uses very well  

## Questions
- I have read that right joins is considered a bad practice in jobs, is there any reason for that?
